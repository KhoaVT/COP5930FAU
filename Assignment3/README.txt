Assignment 3: Implimenting El gamal Encryption
For this assignment we use C++ to write the program. 

When the program is executed, it will ask user to input a prime number pr. If you enter a non-prime number, it will ask you to enter again until pr is a prime number.
Next it will ask you to enter any value gg, gg must be in range (1, pr-1)
Next, you enter a secret key xx, xx must be in range (1,pr-1)
Next, you enter a value representing the message that you want to send.

Encryption
The program will ask you enter an integer k number to do the encryption, k must be in range (1,pr-1)

Then the program will automatically do the encryption and decryption to return the value of the message that you entered.
