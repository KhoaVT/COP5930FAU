This this the encryptiong DES that I wrote to test
Require:
- Python 2.7
- Install these modules: string, bitstring, binascii, numpy (other modules are already in the library when you install Python)

Copy all these files (ie: EncryptDES.py, ClassProcess.py, Table.text ....)

When you run the program, it asks you to enter 16 hexa value to encrypt. 
You don't have to enter the key, for simplicity I assigned the key with this value: 3b3898371520f75e
The reason to do this because you can verify my program by going to this website and try different message and compare with the program

I still work on the decryption 
:( :(
