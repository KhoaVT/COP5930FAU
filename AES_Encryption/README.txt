Project: AES  Encryption - Decryption

This project is written in Python 2.7

When the AES_Encryption.py is executed, it will ask user to enter a key for the encryption
The key should be 16 characters (128 bits). If a user enter more or less than 16 characters, it will 
ask to enter again until it gets 16 characters.

Then it will ask user to enter message to encrypt. Message must be 16x characters.
Then the program will return an cipher text in hex value.

When the AES_Decryption is executed, it will ask user to enter a key, this key should be 
the same key of the encryption part.
Then it will ask use to input the cipher text (Hex), then it will return the decipher text

To double check the program, this website offers a good AES encryption:
